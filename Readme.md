## Project Description  

The **Timetable Generator** is a Python-based application designed to automate and streamline the process of creating class schedules for educational institutions. It offers an easy-to-use interface for managing trainers, classes, and subjects, ensuring conflict-free timetables are generated for both trainers and classes.  

---

## Key Features  

1. **Add Classes**: Define new classes with relevant details like name and size.  
2. **Add Trainers**: Add trainers along with their availability and expertise.  
3. **Manage Subjects**: Associate subjects with trainers and classes.  
4. **Generate Timetable**: Automatically generate timetables while resolving conflicts for venues, time slots, and trainers.  
5. **Conflict Detection**: Built-in logic to ensure no overlapping schedules.  
6. **Print Timetable**: Export and display the generated timetable in a clear format.
