## Project Description

This **Timetable Generator** is a Python-based application designed to automate the creation of class schedules for an educational institution. It allows for the management of trainers, classes, and subjects, and can generate conflict-free timetables for both trainers and classes.

### Key Features:
- **Add Classes**: Add new classes with their size.
- **Add Trainers**: Add trainers along with their availability.
- **Generate Timetable**: Automatically generates timetables for classes and trainers while avoiding conflicts.
- **Print Timetable**: Outputs the generated timetable in a clear format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for web functionality, optional)
- Pandas (for data manipulation, optional)
- OpenPyXL (for Excel export, optional)
- pytest (for unit testing, optional)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kipngenohaaron/Timetable_Generator.git
cd Timetable_Generator
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
#### Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
```

#### Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the program:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program will prompt you to add classes, trainers, and then generate timetables. It will output the results in the console.

```

## Usage

After running the program, follow the interactive prompts to:

1. **Add a Class**: Enter the class name and size.
2. **Add a Trainer**: Enter the trainer's name and availability.
3. **Generate a Timetable**: The system will generate a conflict-free timetable for all classes and trainers.
4. **Exit**: End the program.

## Example Output

When the timetable is generated, you will see output like this:

```
Generated Timetable:
Class: Math 101 | Trainer: John Doe | Time: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM | Venue: Room 101
Class: Science 201 | Trainer: Jane Smith | Time: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM | Venue: Room 102
...
```

## Testing

To run unit tests for the timetable generation logic:

```bash
pytest tests/test_timetable.py
```
